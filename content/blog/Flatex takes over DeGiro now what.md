### The Dutch online trading platform DeGiro will join forces with it's German counterpart Flatex. The Germans will pay roughly 250 Million Euro's for the takeover, partially in cash, partially in stocks. The takeover is expected to be finalised in Q2 of 2020.

Once completed Flatex will service 700.000 customers in multiple European countries and becomes the largest independent broker in Europe [^1]. Although the future plans and implications are not disclosed, there are definitely some potential benefits and risks with this takeover, especially for current customers of DeGiro. 

### Free Trading

One of the key differences between Flatex and DeGiro are their business models. DeGiro earns money in the 'traditional' way, namely via transaction fees. With exception of a core selection of ETF's, all trades placed on DeGiro will cost a minimum of €2 + a percentage of the trade sum (ranging somewhere between 0.03% - 0.16%), both for buying and selling. With Flatex however, transactions are free of charge. Much like similar 'low-cost' brokers in the U.S. such as Robinhood and Charles Schwab, the business model of Flatex relies heavily on commissions. They earn their money from selling certain high-commission financial products offered by (for instance) investment funds. This type of business model has been prohibited in the Dutch market since 2010 to ensure that advisors and brokers remain neutral. Flatex however is operating out of Germany where this rule does not exist. [2]

## Potential Benefits

So what does this takeover potentially mean for private investors such as me and you? Well, there are definitely some benefits you could think of. As said, the full details of the implication of this takeover are not disclosed, but given the direction and business model of Flatex, it is not unthinkable that from mid-2020 we can start expecting the following from DeGiro/Flatex:

### No transaction fees and running costs

Both DeGiro and Flatex are positioned as 'budget' brokers. Even while DeGiro (due to Dutch policy) still relies on transaction fees, their costs are significantly lower than with any of their competitors in the Dutch market. In fact, the growth of DeGiro over past few years is largely due to these low costs of transactions and almost fully absent 'service costs'. In joining Flatex, DeGiro will have the possibility to leverage the benefits of Germany's financial policies and take the next logical step: Zero transaction costs. Something that will likely resonate very well within the personal finance community in the Netherlands.

### New platform investments

With this takeover, Flatex does not only expand their customer base in Europe, they will also gain a significant capacity for development of their platform. Although it has been said that DeGiro will remain a standalone platform for the time being, it is not unlikely that at some point they will combine the best of both platforms and migrate all customers to a single trading platform. In the long run this will benefit both Flatex but also their customers: with the development capacity of both companies combined i would expect a significant increase in platform functionality in the future: real-time prices, advanced automation and above all: an exceptional user experience.

### Banking License

A minor, but significant detail is that Flatex is a subsidairy of the FinTech Group, a publicly listed company with a German Banking License. This means that, contrary to DeGiro, Flatex can operate like a bank and is therefore not only allowed to 'hold' money, but also is able to create and sell their own financial products like credit accounts, insurances, etcetera. With DeGiro becoming part of Flatex, this license will technically also apply to DeGiro, meaning that it's not unlikely that DeGiro/Flatex will start offering other services in the future, next to stock brokerage.

## Risks

So far, the proposed takeover of DeGiro seems like a good idea, not only for Flatex, but also for customers of DeGiro. Unfortunately there are also a couple of noteworthy risks that customers should be aware of:

### Free trading ≠ Free

It is no secret that transaction costs can become quite a money-drain for frequent traders. In the years that i've been investing i've payed somewhere between €200 and €400 per year combined for all my accounts. For someone like me, who is actively managing personal finances, free trading is music to my ears. However, when something sounds too good to be true, it usually is. The promise of free trading is no different. And although it's definitely true that on Flatex customers don't have to pay transaction fees, there is a snake in the grass and it's called 'Tradegate'. Let's say you want buy a popular dividend stock like Shell at current market price. On DeGiro (or any other 'traditional' broker), you place that order directly on the Euronext (the Dutch Stock Exchange) and it will be executed immediatly for the best available price on the market based on the orderbook. With Flatex however, your order is not send to Euronext, but to the Tradegate exchange. Trading on this exchange is free in terms of transactions costs (better yet, for every trade Flatex places on Tradegate they receive a comission). But - and this is where it gets tricky - Tradegate also has it's own orderbook seperate from the Euronext. This means that the spreads (the difference between buy and sell prices on the market) are different on Tradegate which can cause traders to pay a different, higher price for the same stocks. Because Tradegate also doesn't provide the same level of insight in the orderbook as regular exchanges the pricing structure on Flatex is not very clear or transparant. Some research actually showed that in some cases traders on average pay 1.2% more on Flatex due to the spread differences and higher management fees.[3]. In other words:

> #### There ain't no such thing as a free lunch

You could argue that some of these risks can be mitigated by using order limits or by carefully going through the prospectus of each product. However, for me transparancy is a key factor in choosing a broker. Untransparancy in terms of costs or worse; 'hidden costs' will raise a very big red flag for me. 

### Financial supervision (AFM & KiFiD)

As described earlier in this post, the reason Flatex can offer free trading is because of differences in legislation between Germany and the Netherlands. Financial companies operating out of the Netherlands are in most cases legally obligated to register with the AFM (Dutch Authority for Financial Markets). The AFM is a governement institution which holds strict supervision on financial companies to ensure trust in- and between financial companies and their customers. Because DeGiro is currently a Dutch financial company, they too are supervised by the AFM. For customers of DeGiro this currently garantuees a couple of key things:

- No commission-based services and transparant cost structure
- A seperate legal entity for holding the investments (i.e. in case of bankruptcy of the broker, customers assets are not part of their inventory)
- A guaranteed investment compensation system in case of bankruptcy of the holding (up to €20.000,- per investor)

In addition, most Dutch financial companies who are supervised by the AFM, are also registered with the KiFiD (the Dutch Financial Committe for Disputes), meaning that case of any issues, customers can call upon the KifiD to investigate and decide these disputes. 

However, with the takeover by Flatex, it remains to be seen if DeGiro will keep their AFM and KifiD registration. Better yet, there currently is no legal way in which Flatex/DeGiro could offer free trading (and thus commission based trading) while being registered with the AFM. That being said, the German laws for financial institutions are also pretty solid, but for 'simple' investors such as myself it still presents new challenges, especially because of being unfamiliar with the details of German Legislation in this area. If in the future DeGiro will relocate their base of operations to Germany and will start operating outside of AFM supervision, it is not unlikely that more customers like me will rethink their choice of broker and start transfering their investments to an AFM supervised broker. 

## Conclusion

So, what do we make of this takeover and the potential implications for current customers of DeGiro? The potential benefits are definitely there and with DeGiro and Flatex both positioned as a 'budget' broker, there is a high chance that costs for customers will continue to go down. But nothing is for free, and although zero transaction fees sound great, it most likely will mean that you are paying for it in a different, less transparant way. As said, in the short term nothing will change and the plans for the longer term are not disclosed yet, but the proposed takeover might trigger a lot of personal finance ninja's to rethink (part of) their investment strategy: are we willing to accept the risks in favor of saving on transactions costs? Or do we value transparancy and choose for the safety of a broker under AFM supervision? And if so, what are the best alternatives to DeGiro? 

For now it's mostly a matter of wait and see. The financial authorities still need to approve the takeover plans which is expected to be finalised somewhere in Q2 of 2020. Only after the takeover is completed i expect further details to be shared about the plans for the future. However, being a customer of DeGiro myself i will investigate a back-up plan for changing brokers, in case things go south. Ideas, suggestions or other points of view are very much welcome!

Q&A

- I am about to start investing, which broker should i choose?
- I already have a DeGiro account, what should i do?
- How important is AFM supervision in choosing a broker?
- What is the problem with commission-based trading?
