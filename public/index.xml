      <description>Tachyons is a design system that allows you to design gorgeous interfaces in the browser with little effort.  Because Speed Building this static site generator theme was the first time I used an Atomic (or Functional) CSS system like Tachyons. It&#39;s a design system that provides very small (which means fast) CSS modules that you can use in your HTML. So, rather than writing every line of CSS, you apply the style you need as you write your HTML with easy to understand shorthand class names.</description>

      <description>“Grid is the very first CSS module created specifically to solve the layout problems we&#39;ve all been hacking our way around for as long as we&#39;ve been making websites.” — Chris House, A Complete Guide to CSS Grid Layout 1
 Since I began building websites in Y2K, I&#39;ve lost count how many times the phrase &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;there&#39;s got to be a better way to do this&amp;rdquo; has passed my lips. Most times, while fighting with floats and widths of content and sidebars or just basically trying to get something beside something else without using a stupid TABLE.</description>

      <description>The Dutch online trading platform DeGiro will join forces with it&#39;s German counterpart Flatex. The Germans will pay roughly 250 Million Euro&#39;s for the takeover, partially in cash, partially in stocks. The takeover is expected to be finalised in Q2 of 2020. Once completed Flatex will service 700.000 customers in multiple European countries and becomes the largest independent broker in Europe 1. Although the future plans and implications are not disclosed, there are definitely some potential benefits and risks with this takeover, especially for current customers of DeGiro.</description>
